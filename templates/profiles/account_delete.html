            You'll lose your order history, saved details, SneakCash, SuperCoins, and all other coupons and benefits.
            Any account-related benefits will be forfeited once the account is deleted and will no longer be available to you. You cannot recover them. However, you can always create a new account. By deleting your account, you acknowledge you have read our Privacy Policy.
            <br><br>
            Any pending orders, exchanges, returns, or refunds will no longer be accessible via your account. Iron will try to complete the open transactions in the next 30 days on a best-effort basis. However, we cannot ensure tracking and traceability of transactions once the account is deleted.
            <br><br>
            Iron may not extend the New User coupon if an account is created with the same mobile number or email ID. Iron may refuse or delay deletion in case there are any pending grievances related to orders, shipments, cancellations, or other services offered by Sneaker Head.
            <br><br>
            Iron may retain certain data for legitimate reasons such as security, fraud prevention, future abuse, regulatory compliance, including exercising legal rights, or complying with legal orders under applicable laws.
